# GilletteAd-Twitter-Scrape
For my MKTG 447 Project group members and classmates to see step-by-step the data acquisition, manipulation, and part #1 of cleansing process for the controversial Gilette Ad Twitter Scrape using 2 packages, Python-Twitter and Twython. I appreciate any feedback from the community.

# Welcome to the Tutorial (and Github)!
The best way to follow is to follow-along with the code! 

To get started, download Anaconda distribution for Python 3.7. Once finished, launch Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter notebook is an open-source web application and "notebook that integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media" (Dataquest.com). 

You can access and upload both notebooks from Thomas and myself from this repository so you can run the code on your own. Remember to install any packages that are not available on your machine already.

Lastly, Git is a version control system, and "a tool to manage source code history." Github is the service that hosts Git repositories or projects. (Stack Overflow). 

Otherwise you can just follow along with these README.

#This is how you install python packages into Jupyter Notebook
#The package we will be using to interface with Twitter is Python-Twitter
!pip install python-twitter
